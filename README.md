# Closest_number

You are given 3 numbers a, b and x. You need to output the multiple of x which is closest to ab. If more than one answer exists , display the smallest one.

#Input Format

The first line contains T, the number of testcases. 
T lines follow, each line contains 3 space separated integers (a, b and x respectively)

#Output Format 

For each test case , output the multiple of x which is closest to ab

Constraints 

1 ≤ T ≤ 105 

1 ≤ x ≤ 109 

0 < ab ≤ 109 

1 ≤ a ≤ 109 

-109 ≤ b ≤ 109
